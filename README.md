# **Streamlit Dashboard for Business Case Study**

In this project, we explore how to build a Streamlit dashboard for a business case study. The dashboard is developed using Python and Streamlit. The data used in this project comes from a public repository of the [Rappi](https://www.rappi.com/) company. It focuses on retail sales and provides insights into the context and sales behavior. You can download the dataset from the following link: [Rappi Data](https://github.com/rappiinc/Rappi_Data_Analytics)
